Welcome to the genesis gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! We start of the lessons with
you getting to know me! This program tells you more about me and who I am and is more like 
a cool story line about me make sure to pay attention to the functions used and the variables
how they are approached. Thanks for downloading~
"""# multi line comments pretty useful if you wanna explain yourself
print('Hiya! Im genesis! Lets get to know eachother whats your name?')# greeting the user and we use the print function to do this!
name=input()#takes input of the name variable to use later on in the program
print('Nice to meet you '+name+' I think it would be nice for us to get to know eachother better?')# using the print function to print the string values onto the stream (screen)
print()#empty  
print('My names Cristian and I started doing programming about 7 days ago!')# using print to tell user more about myself
print('and everyday im learning something new not only that I think its imporatant to train.')# more chatter with the print function!
print('The world of coding is so beautiful to me and I find myself lost doing it ALOT!')# print function being used here to generate text on stream(screen)
print()#empty
print(' What File editor do you use? i use visual studio code!')# asking the user what text editor they use!
print()#empty
file_editor=input()# input makes users file editor name using the input() function use it if your asking someone a question!
print()#empty
print(' Oh wow I would love to try '+file_editor+' one day who knows!')# here we use the file_editor variable and use it to reveal their tool of choice
print()#empty
print('I was born in New York city, Queens and its pretty nice up there')# yes its true i was born in NYC also print call function
print('Im from Baltimore and its too loud over here and i miss my country peru')# telling the user that i orgin from peru
print('Thats where my parents are from and the food there is amazing!')# using the print call function to display text
print()# another cute empty line! wanna do this just use the print() cal function
print('Anyways where are you from?') # asking the user where are they from
print()# empty line
location=input()# making the users input the location to be stored in the variable
print()# another empty line of space to make the texts have room
print(location +' Sounds nice, Id like to go travel there sometime. I love traveling!')# using the location variable to reveal where they are from!
print()# empty line space 
print('Im also into spicy foods and im spanish as well! and Im a huge gamer.')# more chit chat with print()
print()# giving room for the text to breathe by making an empty line
print('Whats your favorite video game?')# asking user what their favorite is game is with the print function
game=input()# users input becomes game variable and is later used later down the program
print()# empty line use the print() call function to use this function
print(game+ '?'+' hmm sounds nice I should try it some time hehe')# using print() to have a friendly conversation
print()# empty line
print(' Im glad that we got to know eachother see you in the next tutorial '+name+' see ya!')# using print and a variable in tandem to createa atmosphere
print()# i used the print() call function to create some more room between the lines
print('genesis gathered that your name is '+name+'.') # telling the user that we know their name based off variables
print('genesis gathered that your from '+location+'.') # telling the user that we know their location based off variables
print('genesis gathered that you like video games like '+game+'.')# telling the user  that we know what game they like based off variables
print()# an ampty void of text and a long line of nothing created with the print() func
 # the program exits here (42 lines in total!)

Did you enjoy the little program i made? did it teach you more about coding or meI hope so because make sure to study and research this source code over and over until you understand
 its functions and methods! We used variables , functions , and clever creative ways to interact
 with user and learn about them and what they like and share about ourselves as well. 
 pretty remarkable id say. below are the functions used and what they do
 Variables Think of them like a cardboard box you can box your data types in!
 they are very handy when you need to gather information or even capture a users input and later on
 reveal the variable in the program for whatever your reason. variables store data like intergers 
 floats, strings! pretty essential!
 input prints the value to stream and takes input from the user on keyboard and enter
 the input function can be used in alot of creative ways, insert it when you want to gather a users answer
 and store them in variables for later use. Ask a question in print then after that link make a variable
 with an assignment operator and put input it will take the users input whatever they texted.
