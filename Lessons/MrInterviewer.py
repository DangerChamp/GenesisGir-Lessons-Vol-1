Welcome to the genesis gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! We start of the lessons with
you getting to know me! This program tells you more about me and who I am and is more like 
a cool story line about me make sure to pay attention to the functions used and the variables
how they are approached. Thanks for downloading~

#This program is about a creepy interviewer that asks you questions beyond the scope!
#The functions and methods on how it was made will be explained at the end of the code
# functions , variables mostly enjoy the code Thanks for downloading!
print('The door opens and a man in a suit walks threw.')#using the print function to print values onto the screen
""" The print function is used to print the values in the containers onto the stream(screen)
and in this case to generate text to the program. Its pretty useful and i first start off by
thinking what i want the program to be about and use creative little ideas to conjure up plots
in this case i chose to make a program that interviews you that being Mr.interviewer that asks
you random questions with a creepy horror type scence set to it!

The print function always comes with two parentheses and any function in that matter and we 
enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an
argument and the print is called a function and in this case im using a (stir) or better known
as a string to make a storyline! so print(    ) and anything inside it will be printed onto 
stream(screen) just make sure its a correct data type: interger , float or a string value.

input() waits for the users keyboard input and when they press enter it takes that input
this can be very essential to make variables by the user and can be used to your advantage
make sure to pratice input() often! and in line 33 im using the input() function
to create a variable using the users input to later use it in the program

Notice on how we are brining life to the character by making him ask redimentary questions
giving the feel that you are connected with mr.interviewer and giving a sense of personality
very important to be creative during the writing process. Choose a personality for your character!
which is the fun part you can create all type of personalities using your brain meat. Is the
character a mean or fancy type? or maybe they are cute and friendly? Roleplay and imagination
is really important as well but its all entirely up to you
