Welcome to the genesis gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! We start of the lessons with
you getting to know me! This program tells you more about me and who I am and is more like 
a cool story line about me make sure to pay attention to the functions used and the variables
how they are approached. Thanks for downloading~

First things first you need to learn how to make single line comments and multi line comments 
so you can add little reminders or give insight on what that line of code does! comments are
fun great ways to just add notes to a line so you can reflect on them later , they wont show
up in the program its specifically for the developer(you) to look at! So Single line comments
star with a hashtag (#) and anything after that will be comments in a greyish tone. Great! now
you know how to make single line comments but what about multi line comments like this one bro?
Easy all you need to do is start the line with (3 quotes) and than anything after that will be 
comments and to end the finish off the line with another 3 quotes and viola! your welcome i know 
im awesome no need to thank me! (─‿‿─)

""" The print function is used to print the values in the containers onto the stream(screen)
and in this case to generate text to the program. Its pretty useful and i first start off by
thinking what i want the program to be about and use creative little ideas to conjure up plots
in this case i chose to make a program that interviews you that being Mr.interviewer that asks
you random questions with a creepy horror type scence set to it!

The print function always comes with two parentheses and any function in that matter and we 
enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an
argument and the print is called a function and in this case im using a (stir) or better known
as a string to make a storyline! so print(    ) and anything inside it will be printed onto 
stream(screen) just make sure its a correct data type: interger , float or a string value.

Notice on how we are brining life to the character by making him ask redimentary questions
giving the feel that you are connected with mr.interviewer and giving a sense of personality
very important to be creative during the writing process. Choose a personality for your character!
which is the fun part you can create all type of personalities using your brain meat. Is the
character a mean or fancy type? or maybe they are cute and friendly? Roleplay and imagination
is really important as well but its all entirely up to you

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from intergers , strings(stirs) ,floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.
ex.( box='a cat inside of it' ) we stored "a cat inside of it" inside box making box a variable!
